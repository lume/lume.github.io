# Cameras

There are different ways to control a scene's "camera".

A camera is an element that is placed somewhere inside a LUME scene, and its
position in that world determines from where we will view the scene, much like a
real camera in our real world.

# Scene's Default Camera

When no camera element is in use (f.e. `<lume-camera-rig>` or
`<lume-perspective-camera>`), the `<lume-scene>` has a default camera view based
on the scene's `perspective` value, with behavior that matches with the
browser's native [CSS
`perspective`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective)
feature.

When you modify the `perspective` value of a scene with a default camera view,
the visual perspective will change visually exactly as with CSS, which means
that the the Z `position` of the default camera will be adjusted to match the
`perspective` value, and the default camera's `fov` will be adjusted so that the
came content on the 2D plane at a distance of `perspective` in front of the
camera that was previously visible will continue to be visible.

In this default camera mode (and the default mode when using
`<lume-camera-rig>`), one CSS pixels across the screen is equivalent to one unit
in the 3D space.

The following demo shows a cube that is 100 by 100 by 100 in CSS pixels. Adjust
the `perspective` of the scene with the slider.

# Perspective Camera

A perspective camera is very similar to a camera in the real world: it has a
view angle such that more things in the world are visible further away from the
camera.

In the following example, a [`<lume-perspective-camera>`](../../api/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) element is placed into
the scene, and we can control several aspects of the camera like the field of
view (fov), position, and rotation.

All cameras start "inactive". When a manually-created camera is not `active`
(i.e. it does not have an `active` attribute, or the attribute is set to
`active="false"`, or the `.active` property is set to `false`), then the scene
will use its internal default camera (see
[`Scene#camera`](../../api/core/Scene#camera) for info on the default camera). Once
the perspective camera is active then the view will be displayed through the
lense of that camera, and we can manipulate that camera to control our view.

See the [`PerspectiveCamera`](../../api/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) class for details on all of its
attributes and properties.

# Camera Rig

The [`<lume-camera-rig>`](../../api/cameras/CameraRig) element is similar to a
real-life camera rig that holds a camera making it easy to move the camera in space using controls for rotating
the camera around or moving the camera closer or further to or from a focus point.

In the following example, drag to rotate the camera around the camera rig's
local origin, and scroll or pinch with fingers to zoom:

<live-code id="rigExample"></live-code>

<script>
  cameraExample.content = perspectiveCameraExample
  rigExample.content = cameraRigExample
</script>

See the [`CameraRig`](../../api/cameras/CameraRig) class for details on all of its
attributes and properties.
