# <code>class <b>ProjectedMaterialBehavior</b> extends [PhysicalMaterialBehavior](PhysicalMaterialBehavior.md)</code> :id=ProjectedMaterialBehavior

Behavior: `projected-material`

A physical material with the added ability to have additional textures
projected onto it with
[`<lume-texture-projector>`](../../../textures/TextureProjector) elements.

Project a texture onto a mesh using a `<lume-texture-projector>` and
associating it with the `texture-projectors` attribute:

```html
<!-- Define a texture projector somewhere. -->
<lume-texture-projector src="path/to/image.jpg" class="some-projector"></lume-texture-projector>

<!-- Use the projected-material on the mesh, and associate it with the projector: -->
<lume-box
  has="projected-material"
  size="100 100 100"
  texture-projectors=".some-projector"
></lume-box>
```

## Properties

Inherits properties from [PhysicalMaterialBehavior](PhysicalMaterialBehavior.md).


### <code>.<b>associatedProjectors</b></code> :id=associatedProjectors

`readonly` `signal`

The list of `TextureProjector` elements that are projecting onto the
current owner element, normalized from
[`.textureProjectors`](#textureprojectors) with selectors queried and
null values ignored.

This returns the currently associated array of `<lume-texture-projector>`
instances, not the original string or array of values passed to
[`.textureProjectors`](#textureprojectors).
        


### <code>.<b>textureProjectors</b></code> :id=textureProjectors

`string attribute`

Default: `[]`

The `texture-projectors` attribute accepts one or more selectors, comma
separated, that define which
[`<lume-texture-projector>`](../../core/TextureProjector) elements are to
project an image onto the owner element. If a selector matches an element
that is not a `<lume-texture-projector>`, it is ignored (note that
non-upgraded elements will not be detected, make sure to load element
definitions up front which is the default if you're simply importing
`lume`).
If a selector matches
more than one element, only the first `<lume-texture-projector>` will be used
(in the near future we will allow multiple projectors to project).

```html
<lume-box has="projected-material" texture-projectors=".foo, .bar, #baz"></lume-box>
```

The `textureProjectors` JS property can be set with a string of comma
separated selectors, or a mixed array of strings (selectors) or
`<lume-texture-projector>` element instances, making the JS property more
flexible for scenarios where selectors are not enough (f.e. maybe you
need to get a reference to an element from some other part of the DOM,
perhaps from a tree inside a ShadowRoot, or you are programmatically
creating elements, etc).

```js
el.textureProjectors = ".some-texture-projector"
// or
const projector = document.querySelector('.some-texture-projector')
el.textureProjectors = [projector, "#someOtherTextureProjector"]
```

Texture projectors that are not in the composed tree (i.e. not
participating in rendering) will be ignored.  The texture projectors that
will be associated are those that are connected into the document, and
that participate in rendering (i.e.  composed, either in the top level
document, in a ShadowRoot, or distributed to a slot in a ShadowRoot).
This is the same as with the browser's built-in elements: a `<div>`
element that is connected into the DOM but not slotted to its parent's
`.shadowRoot` will not participate in the visual output.
        


### <code>.<b>projectedTextures</b></code> :id=projectedTextures

`string attribute`

*deprecated*: renamed to [`.textureProjectors`](#textureprojectors).
