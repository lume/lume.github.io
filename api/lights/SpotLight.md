# <code>class <b>SpotLight</b> extends [PointLight](PointLight.md)</code> :id=SpotLight

Element: `<lume-spot-light>`

This emits light from a single point in one direction along a cone shape that increases in size the further the light goes.

This creates light that frays outward as it travels in a particular
direction, just like a real-life spot light, unlike a point light that emits
light in all directions.

  liveExample.content = spotLightExample()

### <code>.<b>angle</b></code> :id=angle

`attribute`

Default: `60`

Default: `1`

The value should be between 0 and 1.

The percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to a
[penumbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra#Penumbra).
To give the edge of the spotlight's oval a soft fadein from the edge of
the oval, increase this from 0. 1 means that the light fades in from the
oval edge all the way to the center, 0.5 means the light is faded in at
half way to the center, and 0 means that there is no fade in which gives
the oval a sharp/crisp outline.
