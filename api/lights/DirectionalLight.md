# <code>class <b>DirectionalLight</b> extends [LightWithShadow](LightWithShadow.md)</code> :id=DirectionalLight

Element: `<lume-directional-light>`

This creates light with a particular direction all over the world. Think of
it like a point light infinitely (or very) far away, and the emitted light
rays are effectively all parallel. An example use case could be emulating
the sun, which is far enough away that on earth all the rays seem to be
parallel.

The direction of the light is the direction from the light's
`position` to the world origin (the center of a scene's viewport).

When casting shadows, an orthographic camera is used, and shadows are limited
to be within the ortho box specified by the `shadowCamera*` properties. While
light color affects all objects in a scene, only objects within the shadow
camera limits will be affects by shadows.
