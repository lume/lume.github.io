# <code>class <b>LoadEvent</b> extends Event</code> :id=LoadEvent

This event is fired when on an element (f.e.
`<lume-gltf-model>`) when it has loaded it's 3D content from an asset file.
It serves the same purpose as `load` events for built-in elements such as
`<img>`, `<script>`, `<iframe>`, etc, to notify when an element has loaded
whatever it loads.

The loaded model will be accessible on the element's `.threeModel` property.

Example (plain HTML):

```html
<lume-scene>
  <lume-gltf-model id="rocket" src="./rocket-ship.gltf"></lume-gltf-model>
</lume-scene>

<script type="module">
  import 'lume'

  const el = document.getElementById('rocket')

  el.addEventListener('load', event => console.log('model loaded:', el.threeModel))
</script>
```

While the `load` event is usable, the `.threeModel` property is a Solid
signal, and it is recommended to use a Solid effect to observe its value:

```html
<script type="module">
  // createEffect is re-exported from Solid.js
  import {createEffect} from 'lume'

  const el = document.getElementById('rocket')

  createEffect(() => console.log('model:', el.threeModel))
</script>
```

Example (React JSX):

```jsx
function SomeReactComponent() {
  const threeModel = useRef()

  useEffect(() => console.log('model:', threeModel.current), [threeModel.current])

  return (
    <lume-scene>
      <lume-gltf-model
        src="./rocket-ship.gltf"
        // In React we must use the load event to wire the value to the ref:
        onload=${event => console.log('model loaded:', threeModel.current = event.target.threeModel)}}
      ></lume-gltf-model>
    </lume-scene>
  )
}
```

Example (Solid JSX):

```jsx
function SomeSolidComponent() {
  let el

  createEffect(() => console.log('model:', el.threeModel))

  return (
    <lume-scene>
      <lume-gltf-model
        ref={el}
        src="./rocket-ship.gltf"
        // The event is not needed in Solid like it is in React, but for
        // sake of example it is usable:
        onload=${event => console.log('model loaded:', el.threeModel)}}
      ></lume-gltf-model>
    </lume-scene>
  )
}
```

Example (Lit, replace `@@` with a signle ampersand which is a small hack for rendering the docs markdown from JSDoc comments):

```js
class SomeLitElement {
  render() {
    return html`
      <lume-scene>
        <lume-gltf-model
          src="./rocket-ship.gltf"
          @@load=${event => console.log('model loaded:', event.target.threeModel)}}
        ></lume-gltf-model>
      </lume-scene>
    `
  }
}
```
