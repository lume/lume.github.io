Element: `<lume-element3d>`

`Element3D` is the backing class for `<lume-element3d>` elements, the most
primitive of the LUME 3D elements.

`Element3D` contains the basics that all elements in a 3D scene need, such as a
transform (position, rotation, scale, align-point, mount-point, origin),
size, and mechanisms of reactivity.

All elements in a 3D scene are an instance of `Element3D`, including more advanced
elements that render different types of visuals. For example, `<lume-sphere>`
is an element that renders a sphere on the screen and is backed by the
[`Sphere`](./Sphere) class which extends from `Element3D`.

All Nodes must be a child of a [`Scene`](/api/core/Scene) node (`<lume-scene>`
elements) or another `Element3D` (or anything that extends from `Element3D`).
If a `<lume-element3d>` element is a child of anything else, it will not do
anything currently.

The `Element3D` class (backing `<lume-element3d>` elements) is useful for the following:

- Transform a parent node in 3D space, and it will transform all its
  children and grandchildren along with it. For example, if you scale a
  parent `Element3D`, then all its children are scaled along too.
- Transform child Nodes relative to their parent.
- Render traditional HTML content by placing any regular HTML elements as
  children of a `<lume-element3d>` element. See the next example.
- Extend the `Element3D` class to make new types of 3D elements relying on the basic
  features that `Element3D` provides. Other classes that extend from `Element3D` may, for
  example, create [layouts](/examples/autolayout-declarative), or render
  [WebGL content](/examples/hello-world/).

## Example

The following example shows traditional HTML content inside a 3D scene, as
well as the concept of a hierarchy of nodes called a "scene graph".

Regular HTML content is places in each `<lume-element3d>` element. CSS is applied
to the nodes to give them rounded borders. Standard
[`<img />` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)
are used display the sun images.

We create a hierarchy of nodes. We give each node further down in the
hiearchy a smaller size. We use `align` and `mount-point` attributes to
align Nodes to one corner of their parent. `align` controls where a node is
mounted relative to their parent, and `mount-point` specifies the point in
the child that is aligned in the parent. See the [alignment guide](TODO)
for how that works.

Each node has the same amount of rotation directly applied to it. Due to the
hiearchy, the rotations add up. The parent most node has the least
amount of rotation, and the child-most nodes have the most rotation and also
are more displaced due to rotation of their parents. See the [scene graph
guide](TODO) for details on how the hierarchy works.

Finally, we listen to mouse or finger movement events in order to apply a
rotation to the root node based on the current mouse or finger position.
See the [events guide](TODO) for how the event system works.

## Properties

Inherits properties from [SharedAPI](SharedAPI.md).


### <code>.<b>isElement3D</b></code> :id=isElement3D

*readonly*

Always `true` for things that are or inherit from `Element3D`.
        


### <code>.<b>visible</b></code> :id=visible

*attribute*

Default: `true`

Whether or not the node will be
visible (if it renders anything). For `<lume-element3d>` elements, this
only applies if the element has CSS styling or traditional HTML
content inside of it (children), otherwise `<lume-element3d>`
element's don't have any visual output by default.  Other nodes that
have default visual output like `<lume-box>` or `<lume-sphere>` will
not be visible if this is false, and their rendering mechanics will
be skipped.

If an `Element3D` is not visible, its children are also not visible.
        

## Methods

Inherits methods from [SharedAPI](SharedAPI.md).


### <code>.<b>constructor</b>(): void</code> :id=constructor

Create a `Element3D` instance.

The following examples calls `.set()` to set initial properties. Any
properties passed into `.set()` are applied to the instance. For
example, writing

```js
var node = new Element3D().set({
  size: {x:100, y:100, z:100},
  rotation: {x:30, y:20, z:25}
})
```

is the same as writing

```js
var node = new Element3D()
node.size = {x:100, y:100, z:100}
node.rotation = {x:30, y:20, z:25}
```
        


### <code>.<b>traverseSceneGraph</b>(): undefined</code> :id=traverseSceneGraph

This traverses the composed tree of
LUME 3D elements (the scene graph) including this element, in pre-order. It skips non-LUME elements.

This is similar to
[`Scene#traverseSceneGraph`](./Scene.md#traversescenegraph) but traversal
includes the `Element3D` that this is called on.

Example:

```js
node.traverseSceneGraph(n => {
  console.log(node === n) // true for the first call only
  console.log(n instanceof LUME.Element3D) // true
})
```
