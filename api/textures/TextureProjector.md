# <code>class <b>TextureProjector</b> extends [Element3D](../core/Element3D.md)</code> :id=TextureProjector

Element: `<lume-texture-projector>`

An non-rendered plane that can be placed anywhere in 3D space to project a
texture onto mesh elements that have `projected-material` behaviors.

For now only one `<lume-texture-projector>` can be associated to a mesh, and
only with an orthographic projection (perpendicular to the plane, i.e. along
the direction the plane is facing). Later on we'll support perspective
projection and multiple projections.

To project a texture onto a mesh element, add a
[`projected-material`](../behaviors/mesh-behaviors/ProjectedMaterialBehavior)
behavior to the element using the `has=""` attribute, then assign an array of
`<lume-texture-projector>` elements, or a string of comma-separated CSS
selectors, to the element's `projectedTextures` property. The equivalent
dash-case attribute accepts only the string of selectors. Only the first
texture is used, for now.
